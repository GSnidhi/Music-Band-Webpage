                The Comedy Factory is the first of its kind in Gujarat. Conceptualized by Manan Desai Co-
                Founder & Programming Director, who has an experience of hosting prime time shows for over 7
                years in different FM Radio Stations of Gujarat. Hungry for live entertainment in Gujarat he
                came up with the idea of The Comedy Factory.</p>
                <p> We are in the business of manufacturing humour and churning out original content. Our
                    performance area has been in Gujarat & beyond and we have been performing for private affairs
                    & corporate shows all over India. We pioneered Urban Standup Comedy in Gujarat and we have
                    been at it for more than 4 years now and we are just getting started. One of our highlights apart
                    from standup comedy is Improv Comedy! Improv Comedy consists of acts that are decided on
                    the spot and improvised. We also perform Musical Comedy & Sketch Comedy.
                    Currently, we are a team of 8 members, Manan Desai, Vidya Desai, Ojas Rawal, Aariz Saiyed,
                    Aakash Mehta, Chirayu Mistry, Deep Vaidya & Neelaksh Mathur. These mad people ensure that
                    The Comedy Factory dishes, out a perfect concoction of fun in three different languages.
                    English, Hindi & Gujarati. We have the most popular YouTube channel which gives original
                    Gujarati content along with Hindi & English sketches or videos from time to time. If you are the
                    generous kind who likes to provide entertainment to their loved ones or their employees, we can
                    take your events to a whole new level of insanity. After a short stint in television last year, The
                    Comedy Factory is ready to take on the Gujarati Cinema this year & bound to expand their wings
                    further. Nominated for FORBES TOP 100 CELEBRITY LIST, this diverse group of artists are
                    prepared & passionate to set new avenues and benchmarks for talent in Gujarat.
